ONLY use UpdateDataBasedOnTab from GUI manager or any other direct GUI source. This will ensure there is no issue with automation.
var Relevant tab will handle lifetime extention of this value, 
we can store it in relevantTab and only update exactly when there is a GUI call.

ALSO use self.swap_tab_view.tab(relevantTab).children in any GUI related functions instead of directly calling self.swap_tab_view
direct calls will occasionaly glitch when automated due to untimely tab switches
